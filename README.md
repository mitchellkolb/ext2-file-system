This project is a  Linux-compatible ext2 file system. The project deliverables were comprised of two primary sections. The first level was expanding the base file system to implement the file system tree. Second level focuses on implementing read and write operations of file contents.

# What I Learned in this Project
- Extreme detail of the Linux Ext2 File System
- Techniques for programming in C using data structures and file operations
- How to create and use shell scripts and virtual disks
- What all these topics are: Inodes, MBR (Master Boot Record), Super Block, Group/File Descriptor, Bitmap, Indirect Blocks, Forks/Pipes, and Mailman's Algorithm.

# How to Set Up

This project was implemented on our local machine inside of a virtual machine using:

- Ubuntu Version 20.04.03 found at this [link](http://lt.releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.3/).
- Clone this repository 
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../ext2-file-system/Noah-Mitchell/`
- Run our `mk` file which creates a new disk image, and then start up the file system with that new disk image mounted. Use this command:
```zsh
./mk
```
- The Ext2 File System will begin running in your terminal.

This codebase and all supporting materials was made as apart of a course for my undergrad at WSU for CPTS 360 - Systems Programming C/C++ in the Spring of 2023. This project was originally submitted to a private repository as all WSU assignments are, that has forking disabled. This repository serves as a backup place to showcase this project.
